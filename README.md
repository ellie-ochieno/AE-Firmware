## Hardware components

Connect the 4 pin Female-Female jumper cable to the OLED screen. 
Connect the SDA pin of the OLED screen to the SDA pin of the ESP32, SCL pin to SCL pin, GND pin to GND pin and VCC pin  to 3.3V pin
Connect the 3 pin Female - Female jumper cable to the DHT22 sensor. 
Connect the OUT pin of the DHT22 sensor to pin 7 of the ESP32, VCC (+) pin to 3.3V pin, and the GND (-) pin to GND pin, as shown in the diagram below.
